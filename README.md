# elec344-project - Unconventional Musical Instrument

This repository contains code for the ELEC 344 (Sensors and Actuators) course project. The goal is to use the sensors to implement a synthesizer/instrument type of thing using an arduino as a base processor.

We intend to use Soft potentiometers, an accelerometer, and the Volume2 library for sound generation.

- [ ] Come up with and post an official circuit diagram
- [x] Test of Volume2 library
- [x] Range tests of accelerometer and potentiometer circuits
- [x] Change tone based on accelerometer orientation
- [ ] Change pitch based on soft potentiometer reading
- [ ] Change octave based on other soft potentiometer reading (TBA, perhaps a regular potentiometer would be better...)
- More tasks will be added as the prioject progresses
